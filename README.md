# Hey there! üëãüèæ I'm Kennedy

I build things with code, but more importantly, I build things that actually help people. Right now I'm knee-deep in a grief support app (because losing someone shouldn't mean losing your privacy), running a tiny creative agency, and generally trying to prove that technology can make the world a little less harsh.

## What's keeping me busy lately

I've been pouring my heart into an app for the Alani Jones Foundation. It's basically a private journal for people working through grief. The whole thing lives on your phone, syncs quietly through iCloud, and gives folks a safe space to process without worrying about who's watching. Built it in SwiftUI because, honestly, native just feels better.

On the side, I run Sovereign Creative Agency with some brilliant humans. We're small on purpose because it makes it easier to actually care about every project. We build websites and tools for people doing work that matters, not just work that pays. Check us out at [sovereigncreative.agency](https://sovereigncreative.agency) if you're curious.

## The stuff that gets me excited

These days I'm obsessed with apps that work offline (because the internet shouldn't control your life), interfaces that feel like they were designed by humans for humans, and basically anything that puts privacy first. There's something magical about SwiftUI when you're trying to build something that feels native and natural.

I'm also really into this idea that tech can support mental health instead of destroying it. Wild concept, I know.

## Want to build something together?

I'm always down to collaborate on projects that make a difference. Whether that's a mobile app that solves a real problem, tools for creators who are changing the world, or open-source SwiftUI components that make other developers' lives easier, if your project puts people before profit, we should probably talk.
