# 👋🏾 Hey, I’m Kennedy Maombi

I’m a developer, designer, and creative builder who cares about using tech to push society forward. Whether I’m working on a mobile app to support people through grief, designing clean websites for mission-driven brands, or exploring new ways to build for privacy and emotion—I’m always trying to make something that matters.

### 🌱 What I’m Working On

- **Alani Jones Foundation App**  
  A private grief journal built with SwiftUI. It stays on your device, backs up through iCloud, and helps people reflect and heal in their own time.

- **Sovereign Creative Agency**  
  A small creative studio where I lead the dev side—building custom websites, products, and tools for people doing good work.
